I'm so sick of these copies
Knowing that I'm nothing better
I put these parts in epoxy
I'm livin’ dark like I'm donny
Might dismember a body
I never fuck with them anyway
If I had any hobbies, it is to murder the industry
I don't fuck with these labels
That's why I keep them right under me with their hand in the jar
And their eyeballs stuck in the cutlery
I dont care what you say
Leave the rotten out to dry
Cut out negativity
Like a butcher with a knife
I don't care what they say
Care what they say
I don't care what they say
Care what they say
I don't care what they say
Care what they say
Flesh in the basement
Always been cut by the hated
All of these fuckers been killed by their lack of ambition
Incision inside of their neck dead
Makin it rain led
Makin the dead bleed 
And makin’ the lakes red
Fuckers that hate me are nothing but loose steps
Nothing but who cares
Sharin no food left
Starvin’ the unfed with nothin but kool aid
I'm aidin the loose heads with thoughts that are imbred
Passing down your hate
Is like passing passing down your genes
Duplicate your frail frame of inconsistencies
I dont care what you say
Leave the rotten out to dry
Cut out negativity
Like a butcher with a knife
I don't care what they say
Care what they say
I don't care what they say
Care what they say
I don't care what they say
Care what they say
Somethin’ inside of my head
Is sayin’ I'm better off dead
I'm better off fillin’ the void with feelings revealing my poise
In violent crimes imbalanced lies
I never wanna hear your voice or see your face
I can't believe you think this way, you're such a waste
I really wanna cut your neck and leave you dead
I don't care what they say
Care what they say
I don't care what they say
Care what they say
I don't care what they say
Care what they say
I don't care what they say
Care what they say
